# Dentistry a dental clinic website
This is a dental clinic’s client side website where people can see the services, know about the clinic and book appointment for taking services from Dentistry. When they book appointment they are able to select appointment date, then they will get the available services and spaces for what they want to book appointment through this website. One client can book appointment in same day and for same service just one time. Client need to sign up and then log in to the website.  
# Brief
 **I build this website using mainly React.js library, Tailwind, Firebase and VS code.** 
- This website has a Home page and subpages call Appointment, About, Login linked via routing also Signup page.
- This website is responsive for different sizes device
- It has shared state such as Footer and Navbar 
- For accessibility in this website I use alternative text for images, clear and simple language, headings and other structural elements. Overall try to follow GDPR guidelines
- I use form with input validation for sign-up and log-in, suppose if user gave don’t give at least one uppercase letter, number and length six then it will not take the input. 
- I integrate with an external API (server side of this website: https://doctors-porta.vercel.app) to fetch and display data, also use date selection to filter only that day’s data. 

## Coding language and platforms:
- **Tailwind:** I use tailwind CSS framework in my project for make user interfaces quickly and efficiently, it also customizable and make it easy to create responsive design.
- **React:** I use React JS library in my project as I have learned this through my course and it can to create a fast, flexible, and maintainable user interface that provides a smooth user experience. 
- **React Router Dom:** As I use react library, I use React Router Dom to route one page to another in this website.
- **Firebase:** Firebase provides a simple and easy-to-use authentication API, which I used to implement log-in and sign-up functionality in my project.
- **Mongo dB:** I use MongoDB to create data for my back-end server side website.
- **Vs code:** I do all my code in Visual Studio Code as it is a free and open-source source-code editor.
- **Netlify:** I published my website (React App (redoan-dentistry.netlify.app)) through Netlify as it is easy to use and free.
- **Github:** I make a Github repository to push all my code and show my code to others by giving repository link. 
- **Figma:** I do my initial design for my website in Figma. 
- **Vercel:** I published my back-end server website (https://doctors-porta.vercel.app) through Vercel so that I can use that as API to fetch data in my website.

## Plane for future:
- Add doctor/authority as admin who can be able maintain all data.
- Add a page where client can see all their previous and booked appointment data.
- Add readable option by online assistance for disability people.
- Add payment gateway system.
