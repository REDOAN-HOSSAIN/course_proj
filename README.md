# Dentistry a dental clinic website
This is a dental clinic’s client side website where people can see the services, know about the clinic and book appointment for taking services from Dentistry. When they book appointment they are able to select appointment date, then they will get the available services and spaces for what they want to book appointment through this website. One client can book appointment in same day and for same service just one time. Client need to sign up and then log in to the website.  
# Brief
 I build this website using mainly React.js library, Tailwind, Firebase and VS code. 
	- This website has a Home page and subpages call Appointment, About, Login linked via routing also Signup page.
	- This website is responsive for different sizes device
	- It has shared state such as Footer and Navbar 
	- For accessibility in this website I use alternative text for images, clear and simple language, headings and other structural elements. Overall try to follow GDPR guidelines
	- I use form with input validation for sign-up and log-in, suppose if user gave don’t give at least one uppercase letter, number and length six then it will not take the input. 
	- I integrate with an external API (server side of this website: https://doctors-porta.vercel.app) to fetch and display data, also use date selection to filter only that day’s data.
